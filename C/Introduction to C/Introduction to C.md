## About C

- C is a high level programming language that's used to desin computer softwares and applications. (high level programming language provides strong abstraction from the details of the computer)

-----

Types of programming languages:
- **Low level programming language** (Provides no abstraction from computer)
  - Machine Language
- **Middle level programming language** (Provides a very little abstraction from computer)
  - Assembly Language
- **High level programming language** (Provides a strong abstraction from computer)
  - C, C++, Java

## Programming Language
- Takes input from the user
- Does some processing
- Gives output to the user

Two things that constitute a computer system:
- Hardware
  - Input devices
  - Output devices
  - Storage devices
- Software
  - Word Processor
  - OS (it's a system software)

## Steps for writing and running a C program

- Write a C program
- Compile it using a compiler
  - Compiler will check for errors, if there're any erros, it will complain about those errors.
  - If there're no errors it will generate the compiled output (low level machine code)
- Run the Machine code
- Give the input
- Verify the output

----

- Files with extension `.c` are files that contains the source code.
- Once the compiler compiles the source code - it generates the object code. (`.obj` file)
